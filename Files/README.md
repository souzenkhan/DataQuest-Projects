### Basic Information:

The code is in Basics.ipynb

jupyter_basics.ipynb is a test file to test methods on a separate dataset not in this repository

The projects in this file are part of the data scientist in Python path from DataQuest

All data pertaining to the projects can be found under the Data folder

Using this as an avenue to experiment, learn, and improve my skills :D
